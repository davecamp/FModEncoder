FMODEncoder
===========
A test encoding application for BlitzMax - www.BlitzMax.com

Installation
-------------
You will need the fmod module from Bruce A. Henderson located at
https://github.com/BlitzMaxModules/bah.mod/tree/master/fmod.mod
installed into your BlitzMax mod folder as /mod/bah.mod/fmod.mod/*files*

If you don't already have an srs.mod folder in *BlitzMax*\mod\ then create one.
Copy the fmodencoder.mod directory into the srs.mod folder.

The folder structure will now look like *BlitzMax*\mod\srs.mod\fmodencoder.mod\*files*

In the BlitzMax IDE of your choice build the module.
Load the FMODEncoder.bmx application into your editor. Compile and test.
